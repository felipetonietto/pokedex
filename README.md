## Discussion

Some of the requirements were not met. I thought the time was too short, considering that I have other activities. I couldn't configure Redux in time, I had never developed this part of Redux with Typescript, so I ran into several barriers. But I left the code commented with what I was trying to do.

The style issue was in the background, as I spent a lot of time trying to tweak Redux. I was sad about that too, because it got really ugly and I didn't even have time to think about something or look somewhere for inspiration. It was practically without styles.

Anyway, I enjoyed trying to make Redux work with Typescript, despite not being successful. My idea was to store the search and access it in the other components.

The folder structure wasn't ideal either, and I didn't have enough time to identify which components could be scalable, which I could effectively turn into components in the Components folder.
